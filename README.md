## Information
This tool was strictly developed to demonstrate how straightforward it is to abuse a service like TikTok. Usage of this tool will definitely cause the targeted video to be on the TikTok "For You" page — increases chances to become TikTok famous. Please refrain from using this TikTok Shares Botter as it is once again developed for educational purposes only. Nevertheless, if you use this, you are doing it at your own risk. You have been warned.

## Legal Notice
This is illegal if you use it without the consent of the creators — in this case, the TikTok team. I am not accountable for any of your actions; this was merely a speedrun to demonstrate how botters work. Please do not misuse this tool.
